                 <p>Any modern car you see in Montreal has several intertwining systems that work together seamlessly to complete a driving experience. However, when these systems get out of whack, nothing short of a professional diagnostics check-up will return everything back to their intended settings. From assessing error codes to taking your car's tuning to the next level, Automotive Repairs's diagnostics work is a great choice.</p>
                  <p>When a customer brings their vehicle to our Montreal location, we'll look at every individual system, from electrical problems to engine issues, each of which can have a tangible effect. The diagnostic tools we use are of the highest quality and capable of resolving even small errors that could be hampering your time behind the wheel.</p>
                   <p>The unfortunate fact is that the vast majority of cars on Montreal roads are not performing up to their potential. With a full engine diagnostics service and tune up package from Automotive Repairs, your car will get the complete treatment and you'll see both fuel efficiency and performance gains immediately.</p>
                   <p>To schedule a diagnostics visit at our Montreal facility, give Automotive Repairs a call today at 800-890-9432.</p>

                 <p>Many people might think of vehicle inspections in Montreal as an unnecessary trouble to be completed every year. While most modern cars and trucks will pass an inspection easily and with flying colors, the service performed by Automotive Repairs has additional benefits that could help you save a considerable amount of money.</p>
                 <p>An inspection may cover emissions and other concerns, but what's really happening when Automotive Repairs looks at your vehicle is simply making sure that it is still safe for driving on many different road types. By performing high quality inspections, we're doing our part to keep Montreal safe and reduce the number of preventable accidents on the streets.</p>
                  <p>In addition to the required checks of a standard vehicle inspection, Automotive Repairs mechanics will also take the time to perform a top to bottom, A-Z look at your vehicle and find seemingly hidden areas that could use an upgrade or tweak. From aligning tires for better fuel efficiency to catching exhaust problems before they start, we're the local Montreal inspection provider to trust.</p>
                  <p>Don't put off your vehicle inspection in Montreal for another day â€“ dial 800-890-9432 and make an appointment with Automotive Repairs today!</p>

                 <p>If you're driving a newer car, then there's a good chance you've already experienced the sticker shock of going to a local Montreal dealership for scheduled maintenance. It's no secret that oil changes, tune ups, tire rotation, and other services cost more at the dealership, but few realize that Automotive Repairs offers the same (if not better) service at cheaper prices.</p>
                  <p>Scheduled maintenance, also called preventative maintenance, is a plan set forth by your car's manufacturer and details how often you'll need oil changes or other service. At Automotive Repairs, we're well acquainted with the service schedules of a wide variety of models and understand exactly what's needed at every stop of the process.</p>
                   <p>In addition to keeping your car running well in Montreal, a scheduled maintenance service at Automotive Repairs comes with the extra benefit of quality. We'll always use OEM parts or better and we've worked hard to earn our strong reputation for providing affordable preventative maintenance that keeps your warranty intact.</p>
                   <p>Compare the prices for scheduled maintenance in Montreal and you'll see why Automotive Repairs is a winner. Call 800-890-9432 to set up your next visit.</p>

                 <p>By far the most common automotive service task, getting an oil change in Montreal doesn't have to be an exercise in frustration. At Automotive Repairs, oil and filter changes are our bread and butter and we've perfected the art of getting you in and out of our service facility as quickly and professionally as possible.</p>
                <p>As part of a complete preventative maintenance plan, oil and filter changes help to reduce the chance of overheating and removes oil that is commonly saturated with debris and contaminants. When you bring your car to our Montreal shop, a friendly Automotive Repairs associate will help you figure out the best high quality oil for your needs and have you back on the road in no time.</p>
                 <p>On these regular service visits to Automotive Repairs, you can count on our team to also check your fluid levels and top up as needed.

                 <p>You may not pay much attention to the wheels and tires on your car, but when there's a problem, we guarantee you'll notice. In Montreal, you need good wheels and tires to navigate the streets as well as a partner to fix them when problems arise. At Automotive Repairs, we're that partner and happy to repair or replace your wheels and tires.</p>
                  <p>If you've noticed vibration or shaking while you drive, then there's probably an issue with your tires or wheels. Over time, it's easy to get out of alignment, but a quick service to Automotive Repairs will get it taken care of and eliminate that annoying pull to one side. Using our professional-grade equipment, we'll use digital testing to assess the problem and then provide the best fix.</p>
                   <p>The thing to remember about wheel and tire problems is that they often lead to bigger issues. Not having enough tread on your tires creates an unsafe driving situation and wheels that are out of balance can cause bent axles and other more costly repairs. Trust Automotive Repairs for your wheel and tire services and we'll get the job done.</p>
                   <p>At the first sign of wheel or tire troubles, give Automotive Repairs a call at 800-890-9432 and we'll find a convenient time to visit our Montreal shop.</p>

                         <p>From batteries and starters to radios and windshield wipers, your car depends on electricity to function properly.

                         <p>Even though it's not related to the mechanical or electrical systems of your vehicle, having a broken window or windshield can just as effectively render your car useless in Montreal. To get back up and running, Automotive Repairs has full glass repair and replacement options to fit your exact needs.</p>
                        <p>The unfortunate truth with glass repair and replacement in Montreal is that the majority of cases will need the latter rather than the former. Once automotive glass has cracked, splintered, or otherwise been weakened, it will need replacement to keep you safe and protected from insects, bad weather, and stones or other debris that can come from the road.</p>
                         <p>At Automotive Repairs, we'll do everything in our power to save your existing windows or windshields if at all possible. We understand that replacing the glass in your vehicle is often an unplanned expense and one that can be costly depending on your car's make and model. We'll help you find the most affordable option, whether a repair is possible or in the case you need a windshield replacement in Montreal.</p>
                         <p>Before trying to drive a vehicle in Montreal with a broken window or windshield, call Automotive Repairs at 800-890-9432 to find the best repair or replacement prices.</p>
